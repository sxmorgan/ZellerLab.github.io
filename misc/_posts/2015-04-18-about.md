# About the site

The code for this site was forked from [the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity (NBC) Laboratory website](https://nbclab.github.io/), in turn forked from Dr. Allan Drummond’s lab website, which in turn took a great deal of inspiration from [Dr. Travis Bedford’s lab website](http://bedford.io/). The [code](https://github.com/zellerlab/ZellerLab.github.io) is openly shared on GitHub under the MIT license, feel free to adapt it for your own purposes.
