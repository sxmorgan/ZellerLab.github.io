The Zeller Lab is a human microbiome research group aimed at gaining a better fundamental understanding of the human microbiome and exploring the clinical relevance of its complex interactions with the host. The group, led by [Georg Zeller](./team/zeller-georg), is based at the [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/) in Leiden, Netherlands, and belongs to the Leiden University Center for Infectious Diseases ([LUCID](https://www.lumc.nl/patientenzorg/poliklinieken-verpleegafdelingen-en-expertise-centra/expertisecentra/leiden-university-center-for-infectious-diseases-lucid/)).  

The Zeller Lab combines sequencing and imaging approaches with computational and statistical analysis techniques to study the composition, function and spatial organisation of the human microbiome. Our work aims to elucidate how  the human microbiome  impacts human health and disease. We  strive for a more quantitative understanding of how host factors shape the microbiome (e.g. diet or medication), how microbes contribute to disease processes (e.g. cancer formation) and how we can harness microbiome modulation to restore human health or improve medical treatments.  

To achieve these goals, we collaborate across disciplines with microbiologists, data scientists and clinicians. We embrace open science principles to promote reproducible (computational) research. We value diversity and inclusivity in an international team of researchers with diverse educational and cultural backgrounds.

Leiden is a vibrant, multicultural city with the [Leiden Bio Science Park](https://leidenbiosciencepark.nl/) being one of Europeâ€™s largest and most dynamic research environments hosting both excellent academic institutes and biomedical companies. Other cultural and scientific hubs, such as Den Haag, Amsterdam, Delft, Rotterdam and Utrecht are very close by, making Leiden an ideal place for working and living.
