# Abstract

Determining the taxonomic composition (taxonomic profiling) is a fundamental task in studying environmental and host-associated microbial communities. However, genome-resolved microbial diversity on Earth remains undersampled, and accessing the genomic context of taxa detected during taxonomic profiling remains a challenging task. Here, we present the mOTUs online database (mOTUs-db), which is consistent with and interfaces with the mOTUs taxonomic profiling tool. It comprises 2.83 million metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 919 090 single-cell and isolate genomes from 124 295 species-level taxonomic units. In addition to being one of the largest prokaryotic genome resources to date, all MAGs in the mOTUs-db were reconstructed de novo in 117 902 individual samples by abundance correlation of scaffolds across multiple samples for improved quality metrics. The database complements the Genome Taxonomy Database, with over 50% of its species-level taxonomic groups being unique. It also offers interactive querying, enabling users to explore and download genomes at various taxonomic levels. The mOTUs-db is accessible at https://motus-db.org.
