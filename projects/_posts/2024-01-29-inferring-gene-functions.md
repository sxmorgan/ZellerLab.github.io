With the ever-increasing volumes of metagenomic sequencing data, the need for tools to infer the functions of microbial genes and genomes is growing as well. Using a combination of classical sequence comparison approaches, machine learning tools and modern AI methods, we are establishing computational workflows for the integrative analysis of gene sequences, protein structures and genomic context to predict the functions of microbial genes. We focus these efforts on genes involved in various aspects of secondary metabolism including xenobiotics metabolism, biosynthetic pathways and complex carbohydrate metabolism and virulence factors. This project aims at generating novel hypotheses from metagenomic data sets on how human microbiota may contribute to host health and disease, e.g. through the stimulation of pro-inflammatory or pro-carcinogenic metabolism or through metabolization of medicinal drugs, environmental chemicals or dietary compounds that are associated with disease risks.
