Morgan joined in 2025 as a project manager and postdoc, having been an MSc student and PhD collaborator of the group since 2018. She completed her doctoral research with Sofia Forslund at the Charité Hospital Berlin, focusing on hypothesis generation and robust statistical methods for clinical microbiome studies. Before that, she studied engineering and pharmaceutical sciences at Purdue University and systems biology at Heidelberg University. Her scientific interest in studying the microbial world within began with a personal health and nutrition journey.

During her PhD, Morgan strived to balance rigorous method benchmarking to understand how microbiome-disease associations are made with the pragmatism of translational research. Collaborating with clinicians to uncover insights into (patho-)physiology, she characterized the gut microbiota of different inflammatory disease cohorts. Morgan’s broader research efforts combining data science and molecular biology express her lifelong interest in medicine, and she especially values how public engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration have advanced the clinical relevance of microbiome research.
