Laura joined the group as a postdoctoral researcher in September 2024. She obtained a BSc and a MSc in medical biology at the University of Duisburg-Essen (2013 and 2015, Germany). In 2015 she started her PhD in the group of Jacco van Rheenen at the Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht, the Netherlands). In 2017 the group moved to the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam where she finished her PhD. The focus of her PhD was to study the dynamics of healthy and tumour cells in different conditions using intravital microscopy. In the same group she performed postdoctoral work on systemic influences on breast cancer treatment efficiency.  

Laura joined the team developing methods for imaging bacterial communities in tumour tissues using multiplex fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). She also closely collaborates with other team members on image analysis and spatial data interpretation. She aims to extend the imaging approach to dissect the complex interaction network between tumour, tumour microenvironment, immune system and intratumoral microbiome. In general, Laura is interested in understanding cancer biology and cancer treatment approaches systemically and how cancer progression and treatment outcomes are shaped by these interactions, in particular with the microbiome.
