## Abstract
Taxonomic profiling is a fundamental task in microbiome research that encompasses detection and quantification of microorganisms in biological samples. Many profiling methods rely on reference genomes, introducing estimation biases due to unavailability for a significant fraction of microbial species. Furthermore, differences in genome size can bias taxonomic profiles. Members of the Zeller team have been driving the development and improvement of the mOTUs algorithm (metagenomic Operational Taxonomic Units) to profile microbial abundances in shotgun metagenomic data by leveraging well-established universal microbial marker genes for profiling. This approach allows the mOTUs algorithm to address both cultivation biases (since universal marker genes are present in both well-characterised as well as novel microbial taxa) as well as genome size biases.
